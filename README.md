  ## Description
 Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms is benefitial for a full-stack web developer.

The task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code; configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
